            "markdownContent": "# Methodology\n\n\n\nBorn in Bradford is a prospective pregnancy and birth cohort established to examine how genetic, nutritional, environmental, behavioral and social factors affect health and development during childhood, and subsequently adult life, in a deprived multi-ethnic population. It was developed in close consultation with local communities, clinicians and policy makers with commitment from the outset to undertake research that would both inform interventions to improve health in the city and generate robust science relevant to similar communities in the UK and across the world. Between 2007 and 2011 information on a wide range of characteristics were collected from 12,453 women (and 3,356 partners) who experienced 13,778 pregnancies and delivered 13,818 live births.\n\n\n\n# [Source](<https://borninbradford.nhs.uk>)\n\n\n\n# Notes\n\n\n\n[Data Presentation: Born in Bradford Data](<https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzdyPiIET_z1UXBmdFFlVmYtaVk>)\n\n\n\n[Born in Bradford Data Dictionary](<https://borninbradford.nhs.uk/research/documents-data/>)\n\n\n\nBorn in Bradford has a number of unique strengths: a) Composition. Half of all the families recruited are living in the UKâ€™s most deprived wards, and 45% are of Pakistani origin. Half of Pakistani-origin mothers and fathers were born outside the UK and over half are related to their partner. This combination enhances the opportunity to study the interplay of deprivation, ethnicity, migration and cultural characteristics and their relationship to social, economic and health outcomes research relevant to many communities across the world.\n\n\n\nb) Rich characterization. Detailed information has been collected from parents about demographic, economic, lifestyle, cultural, medical and health factors. Pregnancy oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), have been completed in 85% of the cohort and in combination with repeat fetal ultrasound data and subsequent follow-up growth and adiposity (repeat skinfolds, weight and height from birth to current age) will enable BiB uniquely to explore ethnic differences in body composition trajectories through infancy and childhood.\n\n\n\nc) Genetic and biomarker data. Maternal, neonatal and follow-up child blood samples have provided biomarker measures of adiposity and immunity, together with stored samples, for which funding has been secured, to assess targeted NMR metabolites in maternal pregnancy fasting samples, cord-blood and infant samples taken at 12-24 months. Genome wide data is available for 9000+ mothers and 8000+ children and funding has been secured for DNA methylation of 1000 mother-child pairs. Our BiB biobank contains 200,000 stored samples.\n\n\n\nd) System-wide coverage. The study has successfully linked primary and secondary care, radiology, laboratory and local authority data. This successful data linkage to routine health and education data will allow life-time follow up of clinical outcomes for BiB children and their parents, and educational attainment for children.\n\n\n\ne) Community involvement. Close links with members of the public and particularly with cohort members allow the co-production of research in terms of the identification of research questions, monitoring the demands research makes on participants and discussion of the implementation of findings. The study has strong community roots and city-wide support.\n\n\n\nFull details of the cohort and related publications can be found on the website\n\n\n\nPatient characteristics Children born in the city of Bradford Claims years: 2007-2011 12,453 women with 13,776 pregnancies and 3,448 of their partners Cord blood samples have been obtained and stored and DNA extraction on 10,000 mother\\offspring pairs.
