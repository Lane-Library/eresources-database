It contains for now over 200,000 different chemicals, 10,000 MSDS and over 10,000 IR spectra. The directory can be searched by registry number, molecular formula, chemical name or synonyms in different languages as well as by physical and chemical characteristics and combinations of those data, and also may also be searched by substructure.  This web site also includes the Chemical Calculator, which calculates the molecular formula, molecular mass, exact mass, elemental analysis and plots the isotopic distribution graph; enter molecular formula, atoms, isotopes as well as groups; and the OSIRIS Property Explorer, which  lets you draw chemical structures and calculates on-the-fly various drug-relevant properties whenever a structure is valid. Prediction results are valued and color coded. Properties with high risks of undesired effects like mutagenicity or a poor intestinal absorption are shown in red whereas a green color indicates drug-conform behaviour.  aMode of access:  World Wide Web.  a22 0aChemistryvDatabases.=^A1002781 0aChemicalsvDatabases.=^A1002771 0aPharmacologyvDatabases.=^A104840602aChemical calculator.02aOSIRIS property explorer.40uhttp://www.chemexper.com/  aDATE CATALOGEDb20061025  aZ0bSTF  aINTERNET RESOURCEwASISc1i6651616-1001lINTERNETmSULrYsYtDATABASEu10/25/2006
